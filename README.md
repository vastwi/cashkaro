# cashkaro
Test for cashkaro website using selenium java

Inside test folder there is a package called tests, this file will have the test related to sign in in cashkaro.

There will be two scenarios in the file :

  verifySigninWithValidInputs - Is for checking sign in functionality giving a valid user mail id and password which is already registerd
  verifyresetPassword - Is to check working of reset password. Since I could not use the same mail id for both test used different mail id for the same.
  
The framework is basically a bit of over engineering for the requirement, but I have tried to set a good foundation framework which can be consumed for future use with out much problems.
But I would not rate it as a perfect framework since there is still scope of lot of improvement.
